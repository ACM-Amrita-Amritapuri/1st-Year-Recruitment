  <h3 align="center">ACM Student Chapter - Amritapuri<br>Task List - 2023</h3>
</p>

## Some reminders...

- *Google is going to be a very dear friend, not only for these tasks but throughout your career, so it's best to learn how to efficiently Google*
- *These tasks are for you to explore the wide world of Computer Science and not just a "Get it over with..." task list. Explore what areas capture your interest*
- *Don't try and cheat, for your own good, it just defeats the purpose*
- *We are always here to help you, just pop a question in our Discord channel. You might not get a direct answer, but you will absolutely be pointed in the right direction*

## The Tasks

- [Create a GitHub and LinkedIn Account](#task-0)
- [Set up a Code Editor](#task-1)
- [Having Fun with Logic Gates](#task-2)
- [Project Euler](#task-3)
- [SIG Task](#task-4)


## Task 0
### Create a GitHub and LinkedIn Account

-  Why make a GitHub Account : GitHub is a website for developers and programmers to work on code collaboratively. It's like another social media app for coders who can help others with their code and contribute to large projects and codebases. Most companies check your GitHub account to see your background knowledge in code and your contribution to various code projects.

-  Click this [link](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub) and follow the steps to create a Github Account

-  'Fork' this repo into your own private repo and update your work for each of the following tasks.
-  Use one subdirectory per task and include a README outlining your work.
-  Note : Don't make any pull requests to the master yet !

*Look into using Git purely from your terminal, it's pretty eye-opening for most beginners to open source*

## Task 1
### Set up a Code Editor (VSCode Preferred)

**What is a Code Editor ?**

- A code editor is nothing but a text editor that is specialized for writing software. It may be a stand-alone program or part of an integrated development environment (IDE). They make writing and reading the source code easier by differentiating the elements, so the programmers can view their code.
- It is an integral part of any programmer's toolbox.
- Most prefer to use VSCode for its support of a wide range of languages, as well as its extensions and integrations
- This link should get you started : [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


## Task 2
### Project Euler - First 5 Problems

- This is a good place to try out your code editor / IDE as well as your coding skills...
- [Problem 1](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler001/problem)
- [Problem 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler002/problem)
- [Problem 3](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler003/problem)
- [Problem 4](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler004/problem)
- [Problem 5](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler005/problem)

*Feel free to do more of these problems / explore more interesting problems in the never-ending problem archives*

## Task 11
### Having Fun with Logic Gates

**What are Logic Gates?**

-   [Logic Gates](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/logic-gate-AND-OR-XOR-NOT-NAND-NOR-and-XNOR) are the building blocks to every digital circuit ever built

-   You seeing this task from a computer? There are logic gates in each and every part of your computer.

-   Logic Gates form the basis for the digital era that we are living in

**Why learn Logic Gates?**

-   Computers only understand two things : 0's and 1's

-   Well there isn't much we can do with a few zeros and a few ones right?

-   And you'd be right. What can anyone do with nothing but 1000101?

-   So, this is where logic gates come into play

-   Logic Gates are decision makers. They take a bunch of 0's and 1's and perform operations on them

-   Everything from a simple calculator to a satellite rely heavily on these logic gates to perform tasks

Simulate and design every one of the standard logic gates on an online Simulator like [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/)

However, if you're a very cultured person like the good folks at ACM, design all of the logic gates in .... *drumroll please* [MINECRAFT](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047116432-Try-Minecraft-Education-Edition-for-free)

We've provided a link to the trial of Minecraft Education Edition if you feel like trying it out. Use your Amrita mail ID to sign up for the trial.

**How do you get started with designing Logic Gates?**

Let your creativity flow through for this task. Learn the standard logic gates and simulate them! How you get it done doesn't matter. The knowledge you gain through this does!
