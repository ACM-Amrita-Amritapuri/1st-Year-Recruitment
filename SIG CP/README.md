## Keep these things in mind:
  1. **Evaluation-Free Zone**:

      This community is free of judgments; your dedication and readiness are what we're interested in. Your performance is not evaluated; it's about assessing your preparedness and commitment.

  2. **Guidance and Tools**:

      Google and ChatGPT are available to help you reach specific milestones. However, they won't substitute for building a solid foundation. The focus is on nurturing a strong base rather than solely relying on external tools.

  3. **Prioritizing Logic**:

      The emphasis lies on logic over methods or approaches. It's about cultivating problem-solving skills that enable you to analyze challenges critically and arrive at effective solutions.

  4. **Competing with Yourself**:

     The objective isn't conquering others but engaging in healthy competition with yourself. Set your goals, strive for improvement, and celebrate your progressâ€”ultimately, it's about your personal growth.

  5. **Exploration and Endeavor**:

     Approach tasks with enthusiasm and explore your potential. There's no limit to what you can achieve; the more you take on, the more you learn. The goal is to challenge yourself and extend your boundaries.

  6. **Integrity Matters**:
     
      Uphold honesty and integrity in all your endeavours. There's no room for cheating; authentic efforts are the key to genuine growth and achievement.
