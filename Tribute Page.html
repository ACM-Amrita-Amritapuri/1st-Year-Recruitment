                <p>In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a "'hobby' programming project that would keep 
                   [him] occupied during the week around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write
                   an interpreter for a "new scripting language [he] had been thinking about lately: a descendant of 
                   ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers". He attributes choosing the name "Python" to "being in a 
                   slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)".

                In 1999, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal 
                to DARPA called "Computer Programming for Everybody", 
                in which he further defined his goals for Python:<br>
                <li>
                    An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as 
                    major competitors
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development
                </li>
                <li>
                    Code that is as understandable as plain English
                </li>
                <li> 
                    for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times

                    At Google, Van Rossum developed Mondrian, a web-based code 
                    review system written in Python and used within the company. 
                    He named the software after the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.
                    He named another related software project after Gerrit Rietveld, 
                    a Dutch designer.
