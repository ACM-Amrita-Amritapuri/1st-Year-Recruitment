## Task 2: Platformer

Objective: Create a self-contained 2D platformer where the player navigates a character through various platforms, avoids obstacles, collects items, and reaches the end goal. The project should be unique and not a direct replication of any YouTube tutorial.

Requirements:

Design a simple platformer-level layout, including platforms, obstacles, and a goal.

Enable the main character to move left, right, and jump.

Include a scoring system to track collected items.

Implement basic physics for character movement and interactions.

Create a start screen with a play button.

Create an end screen displaying the player's score and a replay button.

Provide a brief game description and instructions.

Optional Objectives (at least one must be fulfilled):

Create a main character sprite by hand.

Design a collectible item (e.g., coins, stars) by hand. Create a simple background or tileset by hand.

Design animations (walk, jump, idle) or obstacles by hand.


## 3D Tasks

## Task 1: 3D Game Development

Objective: Design a 3D environment featuring a coin collection mechanic.

Requirements:

Character Integration:

Import a character from the Unity Asset Store to serve as the main player.

Implement basic player controls (movement, jump, interactions).

Environment Setup:

Use the Low Poly Simple Nature Pack as the base environment.

Extend the environment using creative designs and additional assets if needed (ensure they align with the art style).

Core Gameplay Mechanic:

Introduce a coin collection mechanic.

Randomly spawn coins each time the game starts.

Design engaging placements for coins (hidden spots, requiring exploration).

Optional Tasks:

Add sound effects for coin collection.

Update the score when a coin is collected.


## Task 2: 3D FPP Game

Objective: Create a self-contained 3D third-person shooter where the player navigates a level, shoots targets, avoids obstacles, and reaches a checkpoint. The project should be unique and not a direct replication of any YouTube tutorial.

Requirements:

Design a simple level layout with obstacles, targets, and a checkpoint (Unity Asset Store assets allowed).

Enable the character to move, aim, and shoot. Implement basic aiming and shooting mechanics.

Include a scoring system to track targets hit. Add physics for character movement and interactions.

Create a start screen with a play button. Create an end screen displaying the player's score and a replay button.

Provide a game description and instructions.

Optional Objectives (at least one must be fulfilled):

Create custom assets by hand (e.g., character model, weapon, environmental asset, animations, or enemy/target design).

Guidelines Submission Requirements:

Use Unity for development.

Utilize Unity Asset Store assets as needed.

Submission:

Submit the Unity project files. Provide a short gameplay video (1-2 minutes) showcasing features.
