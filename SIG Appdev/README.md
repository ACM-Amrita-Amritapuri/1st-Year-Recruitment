# Simple Mobile To-Do List Application

## Objective:
Develop a mobile application that allows users to manage tasks in a to-do list format. The app should allow users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks with an easy-to-use interface.

---

## Features:

### 1. Task Management:
- **Add a Task:** Users should be able to add new tasks by entering a task name.
- **Mark a Task as Completed:** Users should be able to mark tasks as completed with a checkbox or by clicking on the task.
- **Visual Indicator:** Completed tasks should have a visual indicator (e.g., strikethrough or a different color).
- **Delete a Task:** Users should be able to remove tasks from the list.

### 2. User Interface:
- **Task List:** The main screen should display all tasks in a scrollable list.
- **Add Task Button:** There should be a button to open a new screen where users can add tasks.
- **Clear Layout:** The layout should be simple, with clearly identifiable buttons/icons.

### 3. Navigation:
- **Multiple Screens:**
  - A **Home Screen** listing tasks.
  - An **Add Task Screen** for input.
- Navigation between screens should be intuitive.

### 4. Persistence:
- **Task Storage:** Tasks should be saved locally (Shared Preferences, SQLite, or similar).
- **Data Persistence:** Tasks should remain available even after the app is closed and reopened.

### 5. Task Interaction:
- **Task Deletion:** Users should be able to delete tasks by swiping or tapping a delete button.
- **Mark Completed:** Tasks can be toggled between pending and completed. Completed tasks should have a visual distinction (e.g., strikethrough text).

---

## Optional Features (Extra Credit):
- **Task Sorting:** Allow sorting tasks by status (e.g., completed/pending) or due date.
- **Deadline or Priority:** Users can set deadlines or assign priorities to tasks.
- **Task Categories:** Categorize tasks or add tags for better organization.
- **Notifications:** Implement reminders for pending tasks.
- **Task Editing:** Allow users to edit tasks after they have been created.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance:** The app should load quickly, even with many tasks.
- **Usability:** The app should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and responsive.
- **Security:** Ensure task data is stored securely (especially if dealing with sensitive data).

---

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
2. Tasks persist between app sessions.
3. The UI is user-friendly and responsive across devices.
4. The app is stable, with no major bugs or crashes.
