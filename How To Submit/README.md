## General Tasks
### Task 0
In this folder, put screenshots of your GitHub and LinkedIn accounts.


### Task 1
In this folder, upload the screenshot of the code editor you  have set up or are using.


### Task 2
Uploading content in this folder is optional. However, a question based on logic gates will be asked during your interview round. If implemented, you can upload the files or screenshots of the logic gates. 


### Task 3
Here, are 5 HackerRank coding questions. For each question, upload screenshots of the question, your code, and the successful test cases after running.


If the language you are using is not in the HackerRank question, i.e., the 1st question, then upload the code file.


## SIG Tasks
Similar to the general tasks, upload the necessary screenshot(s) and/or file(s) in the SIG folder. The SIG folders should be named as "**SIG *{SIG Name}* Task *{Task Number}***".


*For CP then is no need for SIG folder(s)*
