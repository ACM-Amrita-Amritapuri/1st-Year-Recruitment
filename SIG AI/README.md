## AI Task 1 – Deep Learning

### Objective
- Complete the Introduction to Deep Learning Module in Kaggle.
- Build a small DNN architecture and train the model using a random Image Classification Dataset.

### Submission
Create a "Task1" folder in your submission repository.Upload the completion certificate and Jupyter Notebook of your implementation.

## AI Task 2 – Using trained models

### Objective
- Select a well-known or preferred LLM model (GPT, LLaMa, Mistral, Gemini, etc.) from any of the open sources (Hugging face, Git, Kaggle, etc.). Offline/API is accepted.
- Create a chat interface using Streamlit or any preferred GUI tool.
- Develop an interactive Chatbot utilizing the selected model and GUI. Clearly elaborate on the model details, description, and source in a PDF within the project folder.

### Submission
Push the entire project folder as Task2 into your GitHub repository. Include a brief video demonstrating Bot interaction in Markdown. Exclude model weights from the folder if they exceed a heavy size.

## AI Task 3 – Transfer Learning

### Objective
- Select a model (YOLO, Res-Net, SSD) of your choice and do the transfer learning on the model with a random object detection Dataset taken from Kaggle, UCI, etc.
- Evaluate model performance and metrics, providing a concise overview of the model architecture and a thorough explanation of each step in adjacent Markdown.

### Submission
Along with the above tasks, the following Notebook should be pushed in a Task3 folder in your submission Git Repo.

**NOTE**: Make sure to organize your submission according to the given instructions. If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to ask. The submission will be done through a separate submission link where you will have to submit your GitHub link of the tasks.
