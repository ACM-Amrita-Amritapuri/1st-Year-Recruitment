# Cybersecurity Tasks - ACM

## Reversing Task 1

The provided file is an executable in machine language or partial binary. To get a detailed idea of the executable file, use online decompilers or specialized tools. Recommended tools include:

- **Ghidra**: Open-source reverse engineering tool.
- **Binary Ninja**: Binary analysis platform.
- **GDB**: Linux-based debugger for assembly.
- **IDA Pro**: Windows-based debugger and decompiler.

### Walkthrough (Windows)
To reverse engineer the file in a Windows environment, refer to `[requirement.c]`. Use tools like **IDA Pro** or **x64dbg** for in-depth analysis.

## Cryptography Task

The file `[code.py]` contains cryptographic operations.

XSS Tasks (Prompt 1)

---

### Challenges

1. **Machine Access**:
   - Try accessing the machine to retrieve the password.
   - Download the folder and open `[mustang.vbox]`, a vulnerable machine file.
   - Analyze vulnerabilities and exploit them as needed.

2. **OWASP Juice Shop**:
   - Complete tasks on the **TryHackMe OWASP Juice Shop**.

3. **Pwn College**:
   - Solve tasks 1 to 10 on **Pwn College**.

---

## Reversing Challenges

1. **Java Reversing**:
   - Explore the feasibility of reversing Java programs.
   - Investigate if Java has inbuilt reversing functions.

2. **C Reversing**:
   - Analyze a basic C-executable file.
   - Use tools like:
     - Debuggers (e.g., **GDB**, **x64dbg**).
     - Decompilers (e.g., **IDA Pro**, **Ghidra**).
     - Disassemblers for low-level analysis.

---

## Tasks Summary

- Reverse engineer the executable file.
- Analyze cryptographic code in `[code.py]`.
- Complete XSS challenges on **OWASP Juice Shop** and **Pwn College**.
- Investigate reversing techniques for Java and C files.
- Access and exploit the vulnerable virtual machine `[mustang.vbox]`.
