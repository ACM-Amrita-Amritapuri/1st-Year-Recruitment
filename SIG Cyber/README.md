# Set-1

<u>Objective</u> : Strengthening Linux Fundamentals

Try the three rooms given below:
- (Part1) : [https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1]
- (Part2) : [https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart2]
- (Part3) : [https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart3]

**Make a list of the commands learned**

After Going through the room try solving challenges from (Bandit)[https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html] up to level 25.


# Set-2

<u>Objective</u> : Testing Basic CTF skills

Here, read about the various domains which are given in CTF's: 
- Reversing
- Binary Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Web exploitation
- Forensics


## Crypto Challenges:

### Basic XOR:

Let's see how well you know the properties of XOR. Remember the flag format ```recr{``` It might be useful......XD.

```ct=1017161a133a4207375c0b1c01371c0d07120015```


### BASED!

It's just a game of bases ;)

```ct= JRTEQN2KIQ2EYTSQK5MHERBRNF3FUYKDJNRVETSBKJZHA6BUKU2TOOLFNJIDCY2FONTEO52QGJZWKWSIHFCDKRBXIZ5DMYKKN5GTK33BPBBW2RRUMNUG6N3ZJBGVQ3KLLJMFATDDGJYEO52FOF4EQNLYGNRGES32MZYU22CWI5FXKVKXMF5FGWCRONQTQWDKKJJHSOLSHBLTQRTLOEZDGVKBGFZUUUDIIZZA==== ```


### Implementations:

Read about the Greatest Common Divisor And the Extended GCD. Try implementing it in any programming language you are comfortable in.
