## True Hacking Begins...

### **"Outrun the Ordinary, If You Can Catch the Mustang"**

#### Objective:
Gain access to a vulnerable virtual machine to retrieve the password. The file `[mustang.vbox]` can be accessed here: [Download Mustang.vbox](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j7IucVOgTE8mXuv768rsaQ7Z_8ejeCnT?usp=drive_link).

#### Steps:
1. **Preparation:**
   - Download the folder and open the `[mustang.vbox]` file in virtual box.
2. **Information Gathering:**
   - Enumerate services, open ports, and running applications on the machine.
3. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - Identify potential weaknesses using vulnerability scanners or manual analysis.
5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Elevate permissions to gain full control over the system.
6. **Retrieve the password**

- Document all findings, including:
  - Steps taken to analyze and exploit the machine.
  - Tools and techniques used.
  - Challenges faced and solutions developed.
  - Key lessons learned from the process.

## Reversing Challenges

### 1. **Java Reversing**
- Investigate the feasibility of reversing Java programs.
- Explore whether Java has built-in reversing functions or tools.

### 2. **C Reversing**
- Analyze a basic C-executable file using the following tools:
  - Debuggers (e.g., **GDB**, **x64dbg**).
  - Decompilers (e.g., **IDA Pro**, **Ghidra**).
  - Disassemblers for low-level code analysis.

Prepare a report detailing:
- Insights gained during the reversing process.
- Tools and techniques used.
- Code snippets or visual examples where applicable.
