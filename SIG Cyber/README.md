# Set-1

<u>Objective</u> : Strengthening Linux Fundamentals

Try the three rooms given below:
- (Part1)[https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1]
- (Part2)[https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart2]
- (Part3)[https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart3]

**Make a list of the commands learnt**

After Going through room try solving challenges from (Bandit)[https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html] upto level 25.


# Set-2

<u>Objective</u> : Testing Basic CTF skills

Here, read about the various domains which are given in ctf's (Reversing, Binary Exploitation, Cryptography,Web exploitation,Forensics).


## Crypto Challenges:

### Basic XOR:

Lets see how well do you know the properties of XOR . Remember the flag format ```recr{``` It might be useull XD.

```ct=1017161a133a4207375c0b1c01371c0d07120015```


### BASED!

Its just a game of bases ;)

```ct= JRTEQN2KIQ2EYTSQK5MHERBRNF3FUYKDJNRVETSBKJZHA6BUKU2TOOLFNJIDCY2FONTEO52QGJZWKWSIHFCDKRBXIZ5DMYKKN5GTK33BPBBW2RRUMNUG6N3ZJBGVQ3KLLJMFATDDGJYEO52FOF4EQNLYGNRGES32MZYU22CWI5FXKVKXMF5FGWCRONQTQWDKKJJHSOLSHBLTQRTLOEZDGVKBGFZUUUDIIZZA==== ```


### Implementations:

Read about Greatest Common Divisor And the Extended GCD. Try implementing it any programming language you are comfortable in.

### Heck_s
Solve the challenges given in set 1 of cryptohack. Document the solutions with the code properly.

## Web Exploitation

### Natas
Do the challenges from 1-20 . Make sure to document your progress for each level.

### Tryhackme
Read through and solve the challenges in the room (https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop102021)




## Reverse Engineering

Get Comfortable with assembly language, try coding a simple hello world program using pure assembly.

you could also use this for reference(https://pwn.college/fundamentals/assembly-crash-course)

Try completing the course along with the challenges.
